I'm going to write random thoughts in my head into this file as I'm using this, both for my own interest, but maybe for the folks building this stuff as well.

- A route handler being `() => render(...)` is nice, but I wanted to just remove uses from the existing `{ uses: [], handler: () => {} }`,  to make it `{ handler: () => {} }`, and that wasn't valid TS / error'd out the backend when I visited the route.
- I noticed in the demo code, there was both 'fragments', and also hydrated components, at the moment I'm honestly not 200% sure the difference between them, and what a `<Frame />` is and such, I did just tear out a bunch of code... my guess is that the hydrated component isn't going to be rendered on the server at _all_? Which doesn't seem to be the case! It looks like it is being ran once on the server and sent over the wire with the `/rmx:...` directives, cool! At least from my perspective it seems like I'm just going to be using this stuff for my demo, lets see if I actually use Frames...
